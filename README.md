# repobkup - Backup all public GitHub-repositories

Many people are scared because Microsoft bought GitHub. I wonder why people are so shocked now. Github is just another cloud-thingy and cloud means: "it's just the computer of someone else". If "someone else" will shutdown or wipe his computer, then we better have backups. Having this in our minds I would say that it's time to make (auto)backups. I wrote this little ruby-script that clones all public repositories of a user into a directory.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/whotwagner/repobkup
```

## Usage

```
# ./repobkup <githubuser> <local-directory>
```
